##DevOps 
### Date: May 01, 2015 
This repository is a placeholder for materials that I used for my DevOps course
###Content
 * _BlueGreenDeployment_; in this project we implemented the concept of blue-green deployment that re-routes traffic based on monitoring a certain application. The main idea is whenever there is any discrepeation of metrics from the deployed application, the traffic will be re-routed accordingly. 
   
 * _ChaosMonkey_; in this project we implemented a miniature version of Netflix's _Chaos Monkey_ service where instances are turned off randomly.  Our implementation automatically detects if an instance turns off, and re-routes the traffic accordingly.   
 
 * _Queing_Redis_ contains examples of SciPy usages that I used in my research. 
 
 * _TestCaseGeneration_ contains Javascript implementation fo a pseudo automated test case generator using Esprima, and Istanbul.
